            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                List Llama as an application underwent around 5 complete resets, in which all previous code was scrapped and a
                new model was chosen. As a result, most early code has less value in being functional and more in how it served as
                a lesson for future design, when a better informed and prepared team was working on the project.
                This is the code changes put in the Original home page.

                A large part of early developement was simply deciphering the provided starter code (ans ASP.NET in general).
                Discovering the file responsible for the home landing page was important in figuring out how all the frontend
                components interacted. In addition, this file was where we first attempted to give our project personality, in the
                addition of a logo:

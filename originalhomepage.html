            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                List Llama as an application underwent around 5 complete resets, in which all previous code was scrapped and a
                new model was chosen. As a result, most early code has less value in being functional and more in how it served as
                a lesson for future design, when a better informed and prepared team was working on the project.
                This is the code changes put in the Original home page.

                A large part of early developement was simply deciphering the provided starter code (ans ASP.NET in general).
                Discovering the file responsible for the home landing page was important in figuring out how all the frontend
                components interacted. In addition, this file was where we first attempted to give our project personality, in the
                addition of a logo:

            <h4>Software Engineering principles</h4>
            <p>
                In this segment, I will go over what good software Engineering principles were used in the provided code.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    As can be seen in the above images, the home page was changed to something simple and more appealing to users. While this
                    is not directly related to good design concepts on the developement end, it is good design on the user experience end.
                    By making the landing page more personable and easy to understand, I also made the overall user experience more pleasant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Perhaps the more important lesson of the code is that it, and the rest of this rendition of the project, are not present in
                    the final build. While it was tempting to stick with the code we had put so much time into, we knew that our existing build was
                    not functional, and that it likely never would be. Scrapping the project, while painful, did allow us to build a better foundation,
                    learn from our mistakes, and make a phenomenal app.
                    If you want to read more about the Sunk Cost fallacy, which is what we overcame here, I recommend reading up on it

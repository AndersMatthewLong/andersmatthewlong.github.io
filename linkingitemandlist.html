            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                One of the major challenges in making this application was linking the grocery lists to grocery items.
                There were two ways to do this, one was to make the database right away through a series of SQL queries.
                The other option was to use "code first migrations." This is where models are implemented and migrations are performed
                using the Nuget Package manager console, which builds the database for you.
                We took the second option.
            </p>
            <p>
                While linking the two tables was not particularly hard, keeping track of what list the user was viewing, and using that
                data to display only the items on that list, as well as to add new items to that list, required several key portions of code.

            <h4>Linking the files through a code first migration</h4>
            <p>
                First, before we can worry about only displaying the grocery items on a list, we need to actually link the two tables
                using code first migrations.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, when we create the GroceryList class, we need to give it a primary key. We'll call this GroceryListId.</li>
                <li>Next, we create a list of of the GroceryItem class.</li>
                <img src="/images/linking/GroceryListModel.JPG" alt="grocery list model">
                <li>Then we create two fields in the GroceryItem class, one referencing the GroceryList, another referencing its Id</li>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                One of the major challenges in making this application was linking the grocery lists to grocery items.
                There were two ways to do this, one was to make the database right away through a series of SQL queries.
                The other option was to use "code first migrations." This is where models are implemented and migrations are performed
                using the Nuget Package manager console, which builds the database for you.
                We took the second option.
            </p>
            <p>
                While linking the two tables was not particularly hard, keeping track of what list the user was viewing, and using that
                data to display only the items on that list, as well as to add new items to that list, required several key portions of code.

            <h4>Linking the files through a code first migration</h4>
            <p>
                First, before we can worry about only displaying the grocery items on a list, we need to actually link the two tables
                using code first migrations.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, when we create the GroceryList class, we need to give it a primary key. We'll call this GroceryListId.</li>
                <li>Next, we create a list of of the GroceryItem class.</li>
                <img src="/images/linking/GroceryListModel.JPG" alt="grocery list model" width="50%">
                <li>Then we create two fields in the GroceryItem class, one referencing the GroceryList, another referencing its Id</li>
                <img src="/images/linking/GroceryItemModel.JPG" alt="grocery item model" width="50%">
                <li>
                    With this done, we simply perform a code first migration to create the properly linked tables. you

            <h4>Now that we have linked the two tables, what do we need?</h4>
            <p>
                From here, we need to keep track of what grocery list the user is on. We'll do this in a variety of ways.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, the user will start on the GroceryList index page. At this point, the program will know the GroceryListId
                    since the model for this view is the GroceryList.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the user clicks the <b>Edit [blank] list</b> action link, they will be redirected to the GroceryItemsController's
                    Index function, which is passed an anonymous object containing this list id.
                </li>
                <img src="/images/linking/ViewModel2.JPG" alt="action link" width="100%">
                <li>
                    The GroceryItemcController class takes this given GroceryListId and creates an instance of the GroceryItemIndexViewModel class.
                    This class contains the GroceryListId. From here the controller passes this object to the GroceryItem Index view. 
                </li>
                <img src="/images/linking/ViewModel1.JPG" alt="action link" width="50%">
            </ol>>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Ok, we have kept track of what list we are on, what do we do now?</h4>
            <p>
                Frpm here, we only need the GroceryListId for two things.
                <ul>
                    <li>Displaying only the items on the viewed list.</li>
                    <li>Adding new items to the list.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Let's look at that first one. This is handled in the Index method of the GroceryItem controller. Here, we 
                    call the GroceryItemAccessor method which queries for all the GroceryItem instances with a foreign key
                    matching the given GroceryListId.                    
                </li>
                <img src="/images/linking/IndexMethod.JPG" alt="action link" width="50%">
                <li>
                    Next, let's look at creating a specific GroceryItem and giving it the montitered GroceryListId.
                    If the user clicks the <b>New Item</b> action link on the index page, the program passes an anonymous
                    object containing the GroceryListId to the New function, which in turn "repackages" the GroceryListId
                    into an instance of the GroceryItemFormViewModel.
                </li>
            </ol>>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                The <b>Grocery Iist Accessor</b> does all the data operations for grocery items in the application.
                I wrote the majority of the code for the current versions (though they are partially based off of earlier
                accessors written by team member Natalie Ruckman).

            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>
                Below is a list of the functions in this accessor. They all perform basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Destroy)
                operations on the GrceryItem table in the database.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Get:</b> This function retrieves a single grocery item record from the database given its unique id.</li>
                <li><b>Add:</b> This function inserts a given instance of the GroceryItem class into the database.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Edit:</b> This function, given the id of an existing grocery item and an edited instance of the
                    GroceryItem class, applies all the properties of the edited instance to the existing record.
                </li>
                <li><b>Delete:</b> This function deletes a single grocery item record from the database given its unique id.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
            <h4>Finally, the highlight of this file, the <b>GetOnlyItemsForList</b> function</h4>
            <img src="/images/groceryitemaccessor/getonlyitemsforlist.JPG" alt="get only items for lis function">
            <p>
                The <b>GetOnlyItemsForList function</b> retrieves only the grocery items associated with a specific list 
                (see more on that topic <b><a href = https://andersmatthewlong.github.io/linkingitemandlist.html>here</a></b>).
                This is important, as when you are looking at a specific list's contents, you should only see the items on that list.
                This function does that by retrieving all the grocery items with a foreign key matching the given list id.

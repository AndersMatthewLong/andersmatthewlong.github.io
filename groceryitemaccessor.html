            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                The <b>Grocery Item Accessor</b> does all the data operations for grocery items in the application.
                I wrote the majority of the code for the current versions (though they are partially based off of earlier
                accessors written by team member Natalie Ruckman).

            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>
                Below is a list of the functions in this accessor. They all perform basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Destroy)
                operations on the GrceryItem table in the database.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Get:</b> This function retrieves a single grocery item record from the database given its unique id.</li>
                <li><b>Add:</b> This function inserts a given instance of the GroceryItem class into the database.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Edit:</b> This function, given the id of an existing grocery item and an edited instance of the
                    GroceryItem class, applies all the properties of the edited instance to the existing record.
                </li>
                <li><b>Delete:</b> This function deletes a single grocery item record from the database given its unique id.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Finally, the highlight of this file, the <b>GetOnlyItemsForList</b> function</h4>
            <img src="/images/groceryitemaccessor/getonlyitemsforlist.JPG" alt="get only items for lis function">
            <p>
                The <b>GetOnlyItemsForList function</b> retrieves only the grocery items associated with a specific list 
                (see more on that topic <b><a href = https://andersmatthewlong.github.io/linkingitemandlist.html>here</a></b>).
                This is important, as when you are looking at a specific list's contents, you should only see the items on that list.
                This function does that by retrieving all the grocery items with a foreign key matching the given list id.

            <h4>Software Engineering principles</h4>
            <p>
                In this segment, I will go over what good software Engineering principles were used in the provided code.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Similar to the GroceryListAccessor, my code in this program exemplifies the SOLID design concepts such
                    as the single responsibility principle and the interface segregation principle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is because the GroceryItemAccessor has one purpose in the iDesign structure, which is to perform basic CRUD
                    operations on the GroceryItem table of the database. This results in this class only doing what it is expected to do,
                    and using almost all that functionality whenever it is instantiated in another class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the code I wrote (lines 1-19 and lines 26-30), the code exemplifies flexible design. Adding a "checked off" field
                    to the GroceryItem model and adding the checkbox (both done by team member Natalie Ruckman) were made easier by the fact
                    that the existing form was simple (because it served a simple purpose), and adding another feature did not conflict with
                    the existing coupling. 
                </li>
            </ol>

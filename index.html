                Hello, my name is Anders Long, and here are 5 segments of code I was
                proud to add to <b>Group 5's project</b> (affectionately called List Llama).
                For the full code, you can check the repo 
                <b><a href = https://github.com/tives2000/361Project> here </a>.</b>

            <h3>Grocery Item Accessor</h3>
            <p>
                The Grocery Item Accessor's purpose is to contain all the functionality for interacting with the GroceryItem data
                in the database. To sum it up, it performs the basic CRUD operations, along with a few other specific actions 
                on the database. You can see an image of the file
                <b><a href = https://andersmatthewlong.github.io/groceryitemaccessor.html> here </a>.</b>
                and download a copy

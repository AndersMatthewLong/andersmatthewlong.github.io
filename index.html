            <p>
                Hello, my name is Anders Long, and here are 5 segments of code I was
                proud to add to <b>Group 5's project</b> (affectionately called List Llama).
                For the full code, you can check the repo

            <h3>Grocery Item Accessor</h3>
            <p>
                The Grocery Item Accessor's purpose is to contain all the functionality for interacting with the GroceryItem data
                in the database. To sum it up, it performs the basic CRUD operations, along with a few other specific actions 
                on the database. You can see an image of the file

            <h3>Grocery Item Form</h3>
            <p>
                The Grocery Item form is a View component of the List Llama website, and it is used to create new grocery items and edit existing items in the database.
                While the checkbox portion (which indicates whether the user has obtained that item or not) was added by Natalie ruckman, I added the core structure of
                the form. The portions of code I am most proud of are:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Here, the form looks for user input in the form of a text box, and inserts the data into the form's provided GroceryItemFormModel.
                        This entered data is pushed into the GroceryFormViewModel's GroceryItem field, which is given back to the controller, which handles 
                        the data from there.
                    </li>
                    <img src="/images/groceryitemform/gif1.JPG" alt="part1">
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                            Of course, not all the data fields need to / should be filled out by the user. For example, the <b>unique id</b> GroceryItemId is
                            set to be 0 so that when the GroceryFormViewModel is passed back to the Controller, it recognizes that it is a new record and assigns
                            it a new unique id.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Then, there's the foreign key. The user should not have to enter this. Since the user clicked <b>Add New Item</b> from the specific grocery
                            list page, the new item should be associated with the item. To do this, the GroceryItem in the GroceryFormViewModel is given the GroceryListId
                            which is also provided in the GroceryItemFormModel.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                The <b>Grocery List Accessor</b> does all the data operations for grocery lists in the application.
                I wrote the majority of the code for the current versions (though they are partially based off of earlier
                accessors written by team member Natalie Ruckman).

            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>
                Below is a list of the functions in this accessor. They all perform basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Destroy)
                operations on the GrceryList table in the database.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Get:</b> This function retrieves a single grocery list record from the database given its unique id.</li>
                <li><b>Add:</b> This function inserts a given instance of the GroceryList class into the database.</li>
                <li><b>GetAll:</b> This function retrieves all the GroceryList records from the database.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Edit:</b> This function, given the id of an existing grocery list and an edited instance of the
                    GroceryList class, applies all the properties of the edited instance to the existing record.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Finally, the highlight of this file, the <b>Delete</b> function</h4>
            <img src="/images/grocerylistaccessor/deletefunction.JPG" alt="delete function">
            <p>
                The <b>Delete function</b> does what it sounds like it does, it deletes a grcoery list record, given its id,
                however, in order to avoid leaving "orphaned" records of the grocery items on the list, we first cycle through
                those items, deleting them all.

            <h4>Software Engineering principles</h4>
            <p>
                In this segment, I will go over what good software Engineering principles were used in the provided code.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    This class, like many others, is a good example of the Single Responsibilty principle of SOLID design.
                    It's purpose is to perform basic CRUD operations on the database. It is, plain and simple, an accessor.
                    Because it is designed in this way, the user almost always uses every bit of functionality in this class
                    when they instantiate it. For example, the class is used in the GroceryListController, and every single 
                    one of its functions is used. This ties into another principle, the Integration Segregation principle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Inteface Segregation principle states that we should make purpose-specific interfaces. This is so that all the functionality
                    of the interface, and only the functionality of the interface, is used in any implementation. While this is not an interface,
                    in any place where this class is used, all of its functionality is used.
                </li>
            </ol>

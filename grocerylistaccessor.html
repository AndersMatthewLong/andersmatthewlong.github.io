            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                The <b>Grocery List Accessor</b> does all the data operations for grocery lists in the application.
                I wrote the majority of the code for the current versions (though they are partially based off of earlier
                accessors written by team member Natalie Ruckman).

            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>
                Below is a list of the functions in this accessor. They all perform basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Destroy)
                operations on the GrceryList table in the database.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Get:</b> This function retrieves a single grocery list record from the database given its unique id.</li>
                <li><b>Add:</b> This function inserts a given instance of the GroceryList class into the database.</li>
                <li><b>GetAll:</b> This function retrieves all the GroceryList records from the database.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Edit:</b> This function, given the id of an existing grocery list and an edited instance of the
                    GroceryList class, applies all the properties of the edited instance to the existing record.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
            <h4>Finally, the highlight of this file, the <b>Delete</b> function</h4>
            <img src="/images/grocerylistaccessor/deletefunction.JPG" alt="delete function">
            <p>
                The <b>Delete function</b> does what it sounds like it does, it deletes a grcoery list record, given its id,
                however, in order to avoid leaving "orphaned" records of the grocery items on the list, we first cycle through
                those items, deleting them all.
